MESA-H5
=======

This is the new implementation of [HDF5](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) support for
[MESA](http://mesa.sourceforge.net/) based on the former ``SE`` format.
It is used by the [NuGrid collaboration](https://github.com/NuGrid)
and provides ``mppnp`` compatibility.

Requirements
------------

You must have successfully installed a release of [MESA](http://mesa.sourceforge.net/).

Latest version of the MESA code on which this implementation has been tested: **22.11.1**.

Installation
------------

Once MESA has been installed:
* copy the ``run_star_extras.f`` and ``mesa_hdf5_*.inc`` files located in the ``src`` folder
into the ``src`` folder in your work directory.
* copy the ``hdf5_profile_columns.list`` file located in the ``test`` folder into the MESA working directory and [update](https://github.com/NuGrid/mesa_h5#profiles-in-the-hdf5-file) the ``profile_columns.list`` MESA file.
* clean, compile, and enjoy!

Profiles in the HDF5 file
-------------------------

The user must specify which MESA profiles should be included in the HDF5. This is done in the file ``hdf5_profile_columns.list`` (default name) similar to the ``profile_columns.list`` MESA file.

Note that the profiles in the HDF5 file **MUST** be a subset of the profiles written out in the MESA ASCII files. So whatever contains ``hdf5_profile_columns.list`` should also be either in ``profile_columns.list`` or is calculated in the extra routines. 
For example, when the default ``hdf5_profile_columns.list`` is used the ``profile_columns.list`` needs to include ``dm``, ``radius``, ``rmid``, ``temperature``, ``log_D_mix``, ``mass`` and ``rho``. The other profiles (``delta_mass`` and ``dcoeff``) are calculated by the subroutines provided in this package.

Also the MESA ``profile_columns.list`` **MUST** contain ``time_step`` if the HDF5 output will be used for [post-processing](https://github.com/NuGrid/NuPPN).

Customization
-------------

The ``mesa_hdf5_params.inc`` file contains the different setup parameters of the HDF5 outputs. You can modify them as you wish, but remember to clean and recompile for your changes to be applied. For example, for productions runs you will most likely set
```
       integer, parameter :: hdf5_num_mod_output
```
to a value of 100 or more depending on how long you will expect your run to be. Typically you would have 20-30 files per run. Putting 1000 cycles or time steps into one file is a practical number for longer runs.

Testing
-------

If you would like to run an example, you can use the inlist and columns files located in the ``test`` folder. An IPython notebook is also provided as an example for the
analysis of the HDF5 data created by this framework.

Known issues and tips
---------------------

You can use the `nugridpy.nugridse` module to work with the mesa_h5 hdf5 output files. Here are some notes:

* if the simulation has been stopped the last file may be corrupted and you may get some error when trying to extract or access data in that file. Just delete that last corrputed file.
* it is advisable to include `photo_interval = 100` in your inlist controls and add use in `src/mesa_hdf5_params.inc` the same value for `integer, parameter :: hdf5_num_mod_output = 100`
